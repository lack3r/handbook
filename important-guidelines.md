# Important Guidelines

## Software Documentation

We should do our best to help our colleagues, by providing good and up to date documentation for all projects. Every Software Project should be accompanied by a step by step documentation, with images if it makes sense that help another developer, clone, build, configure and run the project just by following the documentation. Any assumptions and prerequisites should be clearly documented. In case we take an architectural decision it should be written down in an ADR. Please remember that the best documentation is code. We should make sure that our code is clear.

## Business Continuity

What happens if our computer decides to leave this world behind? We should make sure that we lose no work. Please synchronise code with our remote repositories daily, and every document shall be in our cloud hosting. Thus, when we are on leave, other people can continue to do their work without to disturb us. Also, in case a machine fails we can continue our work without any interruption.

## Code

Every single project should be in a git repository. The remote repository should be updated multiple times a day. Please use small and complete commits.

## Language

Any communication should always be made in **English** (both verbal and writing).

## Security

We should enable two step authentication in all accounts that the company gives us. That is:

1. Our email

2. Our ticket system

3. Our chat system

We do not share our credentials with anybody.

## Code Ownership

At least two people should have full access to every repository. When we create a new repository, we should change the owner to theHead of Software Development.

## Documentation Ownership

When we create a new directory or document in our cloud, we should change the owner to the Head of SoftwareDevelopment. In addition all of our company related documents should be under a related shared folder.
