# Benefits & Perks

Some benefits don't make sense in other countries, like private health insurance in other first-world countries with a well-functioning, national health care system. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks outside the US as it makes sense, though.

## Paid Time Off

QBeat offers 4 weeks of paid vacation (20 days), 2 extra growth days per year, should you need them and the standard national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple extra days, no problem. We use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch. Your vacation time is prorated your first year working at QBeat. If you start mid-year, you should take 2 weeks off.

If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better within reason. QBeat recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two won't cut it, we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at QBeat on your overall mental health. We really do want your work at QBeat to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health.

Your outlets at QBeat if you're feeling your mental or physical health is taking a toll on your work? So many to choose from! You can go to your manager at any time or during one of your regular 1:1 meetings. You can go to Andreas at any time, who with your permission can work with your manager to help you. Additionally, your manager should check in with *you*, proactively, to periodically make sure you're doing okay.

## Personal Growth

We invest heavily in your personal growth. It is not enough to hire the best people. They have to be trained so that they can do their job as best as possible. And technology moves extremely fast. Therefore, we offer:

**Biweekly knowledge sharing sessions i.e. Friday tech talk**. By employees for employees. If you feel that you did something or know something that can help your mates, feel free to share it.

**Two (2) days per year of off for professional development**. Do you want to attend a conference? Is there a training that you liked and you would like to attend? Feel free! Two days are on us!  Just make sure to check with your team.

**Hackathons**. We love hackathons and we encourage our people to compete out in the open to create solutions that could offer back to the society.

**Code reviews**. Reviewing each others code and architectural and design decisions is the best way to improve our craft. Therefore, it is part of our process.

**Involvement in many other training and industry meetups**. Our leadership is actively organizing many other training events and meetups to up your network and skillset. And you are more than welcome to attend.

## Conferences

As said, in case you want to attend a conference, you have two days on us!

If you will be a speaker to that conference, and it is outside Cyprus, we offer up to 500 EUR once per year, to cover your tickets and hotels.

## Sabbatical

Every five years, employees are eligible to take a 20 days paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance, so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

## Healthy lifestyle

We do care about your well-being and fitness. For our people in the office, be assured that we offer **free healthy fruits and snacks** to help you get your daily vitamins and be healthy.

And, once a team of more than 5 people is interested, and weather permits, we are going to have regulars "Walk by the sea", every weekend, so that we do our exercise in the weekends as well, for the people who are interested!

If a team of more than 10 people is interested, the company can pay for a race/marathon every year!

## Cycle to work scheme

In case it is safe to cycle to come to work, we do encourage it a lot! In our offices, we also have showers which you can use if you need them :-) Above all, we do care about your safety, so please make sure that it is safe for you to drive to work.

## We Support your Environment efforts

We support you on reducing our blueprint on the environment:

**Recycling**: We encourage recycling and we have recycling beans in our premises.

**Think before printing policy**: We work exclusively using technology and therefore we are strong supporters of minimizing the waste of paper.

**Plant a Tree Initiative**: We do love supporting the nature, so we frequently organize *plant a tree* Initiatives.

## Matching Charitable Service

QBeat also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day!

## Home Office Set-up

In case you work from home, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to € 500 to furnish your home office, every five years.

## Coworking Space Stipend

In case you work remotely, QBeat will pay up to € 50/month for you to use towards renting coworking space in your city.  Please make sure you're using a true coworking space that's meant solely for working, not a club or social space.
