# International Travel Guide

"Can I bring my work laptop with me?"

If you travel out of the country for business purposes—to a company meetup or a professional conference—or even on a family vacation with your work laptop, you're facing up to questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security.

We have answers!

### TL;DR: Don't Travel With Work Data

* If you don't need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don't bring it with you!
* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterwards.

## Checklist: Before You Travel (Security first)

* 1Password
  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn't have any work logins.
  * Open 1Password on each device you're traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it's in Travel Mode.
* Email apps
  * If you use an email app rather than Gmail in your browser, remove the @qbeat.io account.
* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.
  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.
  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data
  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data. Check Cookies and site data; uncheck all the other items. > Clear data.
* QBeat source code.
  * Make an encrypted archive on an external hard drive of your QBeat git repos so you can download and restore it after you're through customs.
  * Delete all QBeat source code from your laptop.
* Other sensitive documents.
  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop.
* Dropbox / Google Workplace / OneDrive
  * Log out of Dropbox / Google Workplace / OneDrive and disconnect.
* Touch ID (optional)
  * Disable Touch ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.

## Checklist: When You Arrive

* Let us know! Mention in the meetup Campfire when you're through customs and have arrived in the US.
* Touch ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.
* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.
* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to your profile on [1password.com]() and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you'll have full access again.
* Email apps: Add your @qbeat.io account again.
* QBeat source code: Download and restore the archive of your QBeat git repos, but only if needed during travel.
* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.

## Checklist: When You Return

* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the Cyprus.
