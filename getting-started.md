# Getting Started

## Expectations

Getting started at QBeat can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you're learning a new job and new coworkers. Your QBeat buddy, and your manager are all here to help. If you don't know how to set up your machine (or *why* you're setting up something on your machine!), please ask. There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 3 months.

## Your Buddy

Usually when you start a new job in an office, it's clear who does what. Yiannis sets up your desk and gives you your new red Swingline stapler. Maria in HR explains your benefits package. Your cubemate Elias is right next to you, and he can tell you who to ask about payroll. However, not everything might be clear from the start. Even when you know who does what, it's still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don't know where to turn or when you want to chat. So we set up a QBeat Buddy system. When you start, you'll be assigned a buddy. They'll introduce themselves, and they're totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it's nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Setting Up Your Machine

Your buddy helps you with day-to-day questions you might have, but someone on our Ops team will help you set up all the accounts you need to work at QBeat. Before you start, the team will order you a new laptop with the specs you request and any accessories you need like an external keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Get what you need, and keep in mind the demands of your work when choosing specs.

Also, you will be greeted with a one week plan on Confluence and if you have a specific training schedule or training milestones to complete, that will go into your Confluence too.

Our people are provided with:

- a Chat Account
- an Email
- access to our shared folders

And our Software Engineeres with

- An account to our ticket system
- An account to our Version Control System

You will be requested to set up 2FA for all of these accounts. Plus, your disk will be encrypted.

Over time, a resource will be created with all the tools that can assist you in your daily job and a script that will set up your computer.

Security is paramount at QBeat. On top of strict NDA agreements, we have a very stringent and specific security protocol, which we enforce and monitor.

**We trust that no source code or data should be ever leaked from the company's infrastructure. In addition, no sensitive information should be disclosed by any member of the company (such as our clients, the projects we work on, any financial data and other data)**
