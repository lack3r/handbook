# Agile Values

At QBeat, we are proud to say that we are a fully agile organisation. We deliver value to our customers, in an iterative way, in a collaborative way and listening to what helps thrive in their digital transformation journey is what we do exceptionally well. Here you can find what our teams do well as well functioning high-performing teams.

[Susanne](https://twitter.com/susannehusebo), agile coach at Monzo, has very intelligently wrote down some the below:

of the symptoms of well functioning high-performing teams [here](https://twitter.com/susannehusebo/status/1057010882989998083).

* They start their daily standups on time.
* They tend to laugh a lot and have fun.
* Everybody in the team gets to express themselves.
* They correct and edit each other when they go off track.
* They try out new things with appetite. But they are quite willing to admit those things didn’t succeed.
* They often don’t care very much if it looks like they’re working hard.
* They encourage each other to leave on time.
* They talk about how “we built” or “we failed”, rather than “I built“ or “I failed”
* They have lunch together, or some other time within work hours where they talk about other things than work.
* They welcome more junior members of the team, and enjoy mentoring them.
* They have inside jokes.
* They share responsibility for communicating with outside stakeholders.
* They don’t agree on everything.
* They debate between short term benefits and long term strategy. They reach compromises.
* They question each other on topics like accessibility and inclusivity in design and development.
* When they finish a task, they check if they can help someone else finish theirs.
* There’s room in good teams for extroverts and introverts. And those in between. Team members are aware of their needs and communicate those to others.
* I’ve seen some great teams have some seriously stubborn people in them. They can be great when the team needs reminding of why they came up with a certain rule: specifically so the team wouldn’t compromise when they were in a hurry
* Good teams often fight for independence to make their own decisions
* They ask “why” a lot
* They discuss the users of their products every day, and the user experience is viewed as everyone’s responsibility
* If they are remote, they try new ways to make everyone equal, even if it means compromising the experience of those people that are in a shared space
* Testers and designers are included in discussions of estimations and backlog refining
* They respect agreed decision making structures, but argue their points
* The people are not too similar to one another. They think about problems from different angles.
* If someone on the team is ill, the others figure out how to get by without that person.
* They have quiet time. In whatever amount is valuable to them.
* They don’t interrupt each other. They take equal turns in speaking.
