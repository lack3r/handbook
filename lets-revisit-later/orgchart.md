#### CEO

**Andreas Loizou** is our CEO and runs business and technology. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company and the technical direction of our products. That means deciding when to embark on a new journey with a client, a new project, a new consulting or a training gig, or even experiment with a side project. By training and coaching people he tries to make the workplaces better. He also spends a lot of time sharing what we’ve learned about business, technology, and organizations to the world.
