# Where We Work

We are a remote first company. We also love getting together, so we also meet once a while.

## From home

Most people at QBeat work from home most of the time. Every five years, we will spend up to € 500 outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Thus, in the pre-COVID-19 and likely post-COVID-19 vaccine era, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our [basic security rules](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/34/documents/14419) and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

## From a coworking space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. QBeat offers a € 50/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.
